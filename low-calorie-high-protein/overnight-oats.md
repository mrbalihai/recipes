2. Add the water or milk and mix until combined.
4. Add any toppings you want e.g. frozen fruit.
5. Cover and leave in the fridge overnight.



[^1]: Chia seeds have double the fiber and a better overall nutritional profile but slightly lower in omega-3s and anti-oxidents than flax seeds. Personally I prefer flax seeds though because they have a nice flavour and chia seeds can get stuck in your teeth.
[^2]: Cocoa powder tends to make the oats thicker, so you may need to add more liquid if you're using it. Adjust to your preference.


> [!TIP]
> - It's quite versatile so you can experiment quite a bit with the ingredients.

> - If eating pre-workout, ideally eat 1-2 hours before to give time for your body to get the energy from the food.
