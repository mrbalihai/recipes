[^1]: Chia seeds have double the fiber and a better overall nutritional profile but slightly lower in omega-3s and anti-oxidents than flax seeds. Personally I prefer flax seeds though because they have a nice flavour and chia seeds can get stuck in your teeth.
[^2]: Cocoa powder tends to make the oats thicker, so you may need to add more liquid if you're using it. Adjust to your preference.
