2. Add the remaining batter ingredients and blend until smooth.
3. Heat a non-stick pan on a low-medium heat and spray with oil / low calorie cooking spray
4. Pour the batter into the pan to make pancakes of your desired size.
5. Cook until bubbles form on the surface, then flip and cook for a further 1-2 minutes.

> [!NOTE]
> Makes about 3 small pancakes usually.

> [!TIP]
> - You can use chocolate protein powder and half a tsp of cocoa powder to make chocolate pancakes.
> - To stop the pancakes sticking to the pan, make sure the pan isn't too hot. For some reason unknown to modern science, the first pancake doesn't always turn out right ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
