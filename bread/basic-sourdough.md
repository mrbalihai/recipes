# Basic Sourdough

## Ingredients
* 500g Strong White Bread (or split with wholemeal as you prefer)
* 10g Salt
* 350g Water [^1]
* 100g Sourdough Starter

## Method

### Night Before
Take the starter out of the fridge

### Next Day
#### Leaven
1. In a seperate container, take 50g of starter and feed with 50g flour and 50g water. Leave until it's doubled in size (approx 3 hours usually for me). 

#### Dough
1. Mix together the flour, water and salt in a large mixing bowl and leave for around 30 mins to an hour.
2. Add 100g of the leven and knead the dough for around 10 minutes. I used a stand mixer until the dough pulls away from the bowl. [^2]
3. Rub a small amount of oil in a seperate bowl and place the dough in it. Cover with cling film or a damp towel and leave until close to doubled in size (usually up to 8 hours for me). [^3]
4. Turn out the dough onto a lightly floured surface rough (sticky) side up and pull the corners out and stick into the middle until roughly a ball shape. This helps keep the tension on the top of the dough.
5. Flip the dough over and cup it in your hands and the friction of work surface to create more tension on the top of the dough.
6. Place the dough in a proofing basket, rough side up and cover with a damp towel or cling film and leave in the fridge overnight.

### Next Day +1
1. Preheat the oven to 230 degrees.
2. Turn out the dough from the proofing basket onto some baking paper.
3. Score the top of the dough with a sharp knife or razor blade.
4. Thoroughly spritz the top of the dough with a water sprayer. This helps with the oven spring.
5. Place the dough in a pot in the oven and bake for 40 minutes.
6. Remove the lid and bake for a further 10 minutes. [^4]
7. Leave to cool on a drying rack for at least an hour before cutting into it.

> [!TIP]
> - The overnight proofing in the fridge isn't neccessary but it helps develop the flavour of the bread. You could simply proof out of the fridge for approx 2-3 hours before baking. Personally I prefer to proof overnight due to my schedule.
> - The condition in the oven makes a huge difference on the oven spring. You ideally want to trap as much moisture in the oven as possible to help the dough rise before it forms a crust. You can do this by putting a tray of water in the oven or by using a dutch oven with a lid.

[^1]: This is for around 70% hydration. As you get more experienced handling the dough you can experiment with more water for a higher hydration
[^2]: When dealing with higher hydration you can add more strength to the dough by doing a series of stretch and folds every 30 minutes for the first 2 hours of the bulk fermentation. This is a good way to build strength in the dough without kneading it.
[^3]: The time for the bulk fermentation can vary depending on the temperature of your kitchen. If it's warmer it will ferment faster, if it's cooler it will take longer. You can also put the dough in the fridge to slow down the fermentation process if you need to. To tell when it's done you can lightly poke the dough and if it springs back slowly then it's likely ready to be shaped.
[^4]: Depending how you like the crust you can bake more or less time.
